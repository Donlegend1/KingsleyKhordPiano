        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">Hi, I’m Kingsley, and music has always been a huge part of my life.</h2>
        
        <p class="text-[18px] text-gray-500 leading-relaxed">
          I started playing the piano when I was just a child, picking up tunes by ear and playing along to the music I loved. But like many things in life, my learning was a bit of a rollercoaster – sometimes I’d dive in, and other times, I’d drift away from it.
        </p>

        <p class="text-[18px] text-gray-500 leading-relaxed">
          In 2020, I decided it was time to get serious about my piano skills. With no one around to teach me, I took matters into my own hands. I created my own learning system, practiced hard, and slowly but surely, I taught myself to play. It wasn’t always easy, but it was incredibly rewarding.
        </p>

        <p class="text-[18px] text-gray-500 leading-relaxed">
          Along the way, I learned to break down songs, transcribe my favorites, and truly understand the piano. Now, I’m proud to say that I’m a self-taught pianist. And the best part? I’m using the same method I created for myself to teach others.
        </p>

        <p class="text-[18px] text-gray-500 leading-relaxed">
          If you’re looking to learn piano in a way that’s both fun and effective, I’d love to help you on your musical journey.
